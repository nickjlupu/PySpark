# PySpark

## Background
Many of Amazon's shoppers depend on product reviews to make a purchase. Amazon makes these datasets publicly available. However, they are quite large and can exceed the capacity of local machines to handle. One dataset alone contains more than 1.5 million rows. With more than 40 datasets, this can be quite taxing on the average local computer.

### Objectives
* Perform ETL on one of the review datasets.
* Store your results on an AWS RDS database.
* Determine if reviews are biased using PySpark or SQL with the appropriate statistical methods.
